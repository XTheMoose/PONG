# PONG
Python Game using the Turtle Library for graphics. Based on Atari game PONG

This game was created by Tyler Dakers on May 5, 2022 during an enrichment program at uOttawa in creating games in python.

The program was created during a class in which the basic game mechanics were shown including:
  Moving the paddles
  Creating a score
  Moving the ball
  Writing physics for the ball (bounce/boundaries)
  Creating the window
 
 Addition code added to the project by myself includes:
  Startup menu
  Paddle interaction with boundaries
  Countdown for ball movement
  Win Sequence
  Alterations for movement controls
  
 I Hope you enjoy playing my game and I wish for many more games to come.
